I gotta find a new Devil
I killed the last one, now I don't know what to do with myself
I guess I gotta find a new Devil
What in God's name is wrong with me?
What the hell?


Just when I think I've got it figured out
I go and lose my mind again
Stuck on the edge of a revelation
Too scared to fall and too afraid to fly too high
Tell me why
