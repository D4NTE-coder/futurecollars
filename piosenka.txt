I gotta find a new Devil
I killed the last one, now I don't know what to do with myself
I guess I gotta find a new Devil
What in God's name is wrong with me?
What the hell?


Just when I think I've got it figured out
I go and lose my mind again
Stuck on the edge of a revelation
Too scared to fall and too afraid to fly too high
Tell me why


I am my own worst enemy
I feel it taking over me
I am my own worst enemy
Better the devil you know
Than the devil you don't
'Cause the one that's inside can hide
Right in front of you


I don't know what's comе over me
Hope don't
Riding with thе Devil again
I want the, I want the pain
I hear you're
I feel you're stupid to the bone


I am my own worst enemy
I feel it taking over me
I am my own worst enemy
Better the devil you know
Than the devil you don't
'Cause the one that's inside can hide
Right in front of you


I am my own worst enemy
I feel it taking over me

I am my own worst enemy
I feel it taking over me
I am my own worst enemy
Better the devil you know
Than the devil you don't
'Cause the one that's inside can hide
Right in front of you
We're not afraid of you


I am my own worst enemy
I am my own worst enemy
I am my own worst enemy
I am my own worst enemy
