I am my own worst enemy
I feel it taking over me
I am my own worst enemy
Better the devil you know
Than the devil you don't
'Cause the one that's inside can hide
Right in front of you


I am my own worst enemy
I feel it taking over me

I am my own worst enemy
I feel it taking over me
I am my own worst enemy
Better the devil you know
Than the devil you don't
'Cause the one that's inside can hide
Right in front of you
We're not afraid of you


I am my own worst enemy
I am my own worst enemy
I am my own worst enemy
I am my own worst enemy
